# ReactTsTodoRestApi

GitHub project focusing on a To-Do list app developed using TypeScript and React, with RESTful API integration.


## Introduction

The project will involve building a To-Do List application using React and TypeScript. The project focuses on implementing various aspects of modern web development, including GitFlow workflow, component reusability, state
management, API calls, and CRUD operations on the frontend.

## Requirements

### GitFlow Workflow

- This project follows the GitFlow branching model, with branches for feature
development, release preparation, hotfixes, and version tags.
- It Utilizes Git commands effectively for branching, committing, merging, and handling
conflicts.
- It Provides clear and concise commit messages to track changes and updates.

### Component Reusability

- The project Implements reusable components to promote code efficiency and maintainability.
- The project Identifies common UI elements and create components that can be reused across
different parts of the application.
- The project Utilizes props and state effectively to make components flexible and customizable.
State Management
- The project Implements state management using a library such as Redux or React Context API.
- It Centralizes application state to manage data flow and ensure consistency across
components.
- The project Handle state updates efficiently to reflect changes in the UI without unnecessary
re-renders.

### API Calls

- This project Integrates API calls to fetch, create, update, and delete To-Do list items.
Utilize asynchronous JavaScript techniques such as promises or async/await to handle
API requests. (using Nodejs)
- The API documentation is done via Swagger.
- This project Implement error handling to gracefully manage network failures or server errors.

### CRUD Operations on the Frontend

- This project Implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing To-Do list
items.
- This project has custom Designed user interfaces for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting To-Do list items.
Ensure seamless interaction with the backend API to perform CRUD operations.

### Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- Redux or React Context API: Libraries for managing application state.
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes to the codebase.
- RESTful API(Nodejs): Backend API for handling CRUD operations on To-Do list items.
Deliverables
- Git repository containing the project codebase with clear commit history.
