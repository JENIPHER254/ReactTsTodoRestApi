# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# To-Do List Project

## Introduction

- This project will involve building a To-Do List application using React and TypeScript. It  focuses on implementing various aspects of modern web development, including GitFlow workflow, component reusability, state
management, API calls, and CRUD operations on the frontend.

## Requirements

### GitFlow Workflow

- The project should follows the GitFlow branching model, with branches for feature
development, release preparation, hot-fixes, and version tags.
- It Utilize Git commands effectively for branching, committing, merging, and handling
conflicts.
- It provides clear and concise commit messages to track changes and updates.

### Component Reusability
- It Implement reusable components to promote code efficiency and maintainability.
Identify common UI elements and create components that can be reused across
different parts of the application.
- It Utilizes props and state effectively to make components flexible and customizable.
State Management
- It Implements state management using a library such as Redux or React Context API.
Centralize application state to manage data flow and ensure consistency across
components.
- The project demonstrates how to handle state updates efficiently to reflect changes in the UI without unnecessary
re-renders.

### API Calls

- It utilizes the Integration API calls to fetch, create, update, and delete To-Do list items.
Utilize asynchronous JavaScript techniques such as promises or async/await to handle
API requests.
- It Implements error handling to gracefully manage network failures or server errors.

### CRUD Operations on the Frontend

- It Implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing To-Do list
items.
- It has complete user interfaces for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting To-Do list items.
- There is seamless interaction with the backend API to perform CRUD operations.

### Technologies used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- Redux or React Context API: Libraries for managing application state.
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes to the codebase.
- RESTful API: Backend API for handling CRUD operations on To-Do list items.
Deliverables
- Git repository containing the project codebase with clear commit history.
